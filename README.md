<p align="center">CacheInject is a simple way to hide code in the pycache, that anyone shouldn't see. It's not working for cross-versions. The code will execute only if the user that execute the code is on the same version as the user who built the infected code.</p>

## üîΩ Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Izak57/CacheInject.git
cd CacheInject
pip install .
```

## ‚ùì Usage
```
py -m cacheinject [-h] codefile module

Inject code to a pycache.

positional arguments:
  codefile    Path to the file that contains the code you want to inject
  module      The module path were the code will be injected

options:
